### Catalyze AI

Bringing AI and ML applications to life is challenging. Many ideas remain in local or dev environment in form of untitled notebooks. I believe in accelarating this process through focused learning of libraries and tools that provide practitioners with high-level components. Components and foundational concepts that drive the core of ML and DL techniques and applications. These can be quickly and easily mixed and matched to provide state-of-the-art results, as well as to explore new approaches in standard and deep learning domains.

This repo is a collection of notebooks explaining some such components, one by one.
